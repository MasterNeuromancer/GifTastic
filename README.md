# GifTastic

This Website will use the Giphy API to get gifs.

It has some predetermined buttons which will pull gifs of various martial arts. Once clicked it will pull 10 gifs.

At first it will only be still images, but once the user clicks on the still it will animate the gif.

The gifs will be replaced once another button is pushed.

The user will also be able to create new buttons with a new martial art style, which when clicked on will also produce 10 still images.
